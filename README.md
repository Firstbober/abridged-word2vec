# Abridged Word2Vec

This is my (unsuccessful) idea of word2vec implementation without any neurons and machine learning layers.

- `libAW2V.js` Contains some shared fragments of code.
- `generateBasicData.js` Using this file, you can generate vectors and dictionary from some dataset loaded from the file.
- `postprocessVectors.js` Does some small post-processing on vectors generated by generator.
- `finetuneVectors.js` By implementing some sort of loss function and random multiplication, it should've corrected vectors enough to generate seemingly good text, but something is still missing.
